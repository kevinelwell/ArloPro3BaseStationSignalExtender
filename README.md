# ArloPro3BaseStationSignalExtender
This repo will provide information on how i extended the signal from my Arlo Pro 3 base station using readily available parts off Amazon.

(DISCLAIMER: I am not an expert in wireless protocols, signals. Additionally, please understand if you crack open a base station, you will probably void your warranty)

A while back we purchased an Arlo Pro 3 camera/base station kit. The kit came with 3 pro 3 cameras and a base station. This worked great and we talked about purchasing additional cameras. However, when we priced out the cameras, the cost far exceded the cost of another Arlo Pro 3 camera/base station kit. So we bought a second kit and just used the additional cameras. 

After we mounted the additional cameras, we discussed having a camera out by our pasture so we could see our chicken coops and barn. However, the signal would not reach that far away from the base station. This got me thinking if there was a way for me to increase the signal from the base station. Through much Googling, poking through Reddit and looking through the Arlo forums, i found others were interested in increasing the range as well. 

Since i had a second base station just collecting dust, I started down the path of figuring out how to do this.
